# COSC2753 Machine Learning Assignment 1 (Individual)

Welcome to the COSC2753 Machine Learning Assignment 1 (Individual) repository! This project serves as the first individual assignment for COSC2753 Machine Learningg course.

## About the Project ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals based on a set of health metrics and demographic information. As a student undertaking this assignment, the primary objectives include proposing, implementing, and evaluating machine learning models to accurately forecast the status of diabetes development in patients.

## Procedures üîë

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and visualize patterns in the data.
2. Data Preprocessing: We handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data transformations to prepare the dataset for modeling.
3. Model Development: We build machine learning models using the prepared dataset to predict the onset of diabetes based on health metrics and demographic information. We evaluate multiple models and select the one that demonstrates the best performance in predicting diabetes development, considering F1-score.
4. Model Evaluation: We predict the status of diabetes for each individual in the preprocessed test data sets.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with the project:
1. Clone the whole project (repository) and run it in your local environment (e.g. VSC, Jupyter).
2. No further steps! You can explore the project.

## Folder Structure üìÅ

- **notebooks** (`/notebooks`)
: Contains Each step as a jupyter notebook file.

- **data** (`/data`):
  - The sample data provided by the professor (train, test, code book).
  - The preprocessed data from the Data Preprocessing Notebook.
  - Selected features and their indices from the Model Development Notebook.
  - Each model from the Model Development Notebook.

- **predictions** (`/data/predictions`)
: Contains the predictions csv file from Model Evaluation Notebook.
